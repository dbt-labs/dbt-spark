# **what?**
# This workflow will take the new version number to bump to. With that
# it will run versionbump to update the version number everywhere in the
# code base and then run changie to create the corresponding changelog.
# A PR will be created with the changes that can be reviewed before committing.

# **why?**
# This is to aid in releasing dbt and making sure we have updated
# the version in all places and generated the changelog.

# **when?**
# This is triggered manually
