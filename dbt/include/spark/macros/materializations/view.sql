  /*
     This relation (probably) doesn't exist yet. If it does exist, it's a leftover from
     a previous run, and we're going to try to drop it immediately. At the end of this
     materialization, we're going to rename the "old_relation" to this identifier,
     and then we're going to drop it. In order to make sure we run the correct one of:
       - drop view ...
       - drop table ...
     We need to set the type of this relation to be the type of the old_relation, if it exists,
     or else "view" as a sane default if it does not. Note that if the old_relation does not
     exist, then there is nothing to move out of the way and subsequentally drop. In that case,
     this relation will be effectively unused.
