    # N.B.: Mypy is... a bit fragile.
    #
    # By using `language: system` we run this hook in the local
    # environment instead of a pre-commit isolated one.  This is needed
    # to ensure mypy correctly parses the project.

    # It may cause trouble in that it adds environmental variables out
    # of our control to the mix.  Unfortunately, there's nothing we can
    # do about per pre-commit's author.
    # See https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit/issues/730 for details.
