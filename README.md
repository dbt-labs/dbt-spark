## dbt-spark

### Documentation
For more information on using Spark with dbt, consult the [dbt documentation](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/profile-spark).

### Installation
This plugin can be installed via pip:

```
# Install dbt-spark from PyPi:
$ pip install dbt-spark
```

### Configuring your profile

**Connection Method**

Connections can be made to Spark in two different modes. The `http` mode is used when connecting to a managed service such as Databricks, which provides an HTTP endpoint; the `thrift` mode is used to connect directly to the master node of a cluster (either on-premise or in the cloud).

A dbt profile can be configured to run against Spark using the following configuration:

| Option  | Description                                        | Required?               | Example                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| method    | Specify the connection method (`thrift` or `http`)   | Required   | `http`   |
| schema  | Specify the schema (database) to build models into | Required                | `analytics`              |
| host    | The hostname to connect to                         | Required                | `yourorg.sparkhost.com`  |
| port    | The port to connect to the host on                 | Optional (default: 443 for `http`, 10001 for `thrift`) | `443`                    |
| token   | The token to use for authenticating to the cluster | Required for `http`                | `abc123`                 |
| organization | The id of the Azure Databricks workspace being used; only for  Azure Databricks | See Databricks Note | `1234567891234567` |
| cluster | The name of the cluster to connect to              | Required for `http`               | `01234-23423-coffeetime` |
| user    | The username to use to connect to the cluster  | Optional  | `hadoop`  |
| connect_timeout | The number of seconds to wait before retrying to connect to a Pending Spark cluster | Optional (default: 10) | `60` |
| connect_retries | The number of times to try connecting to a Pending Spark cluster before giving up   | Optional (default: 0)  | `5` |

**Databricks Note**

AWS and Azure Databricks have differences in their connections, likely due to differences in how their URLs are generated between the two services.

To connect to an Azure Databricks cluster, you will need to obtain your organization ID, which is a unique ID Azure Databricks generates for each customer workspace.  To find the organization ID, see https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/databricks/dev-tools/databricks-connect#step-2-configure-connection-properties.  When connecting to Azure Databricks, the organization tag is required to be set in the profiles.yml connection file, as it will be defaulted to 0 otherwise, and will not connect to Azure.  This connection method follows the databricks-connect package's semantics for connecting to Databricks.

Of special note is the fact that organization ID is treated as a string by dbt-spark, as opposed to a large number. While all examples to date have contained numeric digits, it is unknown how long that may continue, and what the upper limit of this number is.  If you do have a leading zero, please include it in the organization tag and dbt-spark will pass that along.

dbt-spark has also been tested against AWS Databricks, and it has some differences in the URLs used. It appears to default the positional value where organization lives in AWS connection URLs to 0, so dbt-spark does the same for AWS connections (i.e. simply leave organization-id out when connecting to the AWS version and dbt-spark will construct the correct AWS URL for you).  Note the missing reference to organization here: https://docs.databricks.com/dev-tools/databricks-connect.html#step-2-configure-connection-properties.

Please ignore all references to port 15001 in the databricks-connect docs as that is specific to that tool; port 443 is used for dbt-spark's https connection.

Lastly, the host field for Databricks can be found at the start of your workspace or cluster url (but don't include https://): region.azuredatabricks.net for Azure, or account.cloud.databricks.com for AWS.



**Usage with Amazon EMR**

To connect to Spark running on an Amazon EMR cluster, you will need to run `sudo /usr/lib/spark/sbin/start-thriftserver.sh` on the master node of the cluster to start the Thrift server (see https://aws.amazon.com/premiumsupport/knowledge-center/jdbc-connection-emr/ for further context). You will also need to connect to port `10001`, which will connect to the Spark backend Thrift server; port `10000` will instead connect to a Hive backend, which will not work correctly with dbt.


**Example profiles.yml entries:**

**http, e.g. AWS Databricks**
```
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      method: http
      type: spark
      schema: analytics
      host: yourorg.sparkhost.com
      port: 443
      token: abc123
      cluster: 01234-23423-coffeetime
      connect_retries: 5
      connect_timeout: 60
```

**Azure Databricks, via http**
```
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      method: http
      type: spark
      schema: analytics
      host: yourorg.sparkhost.com
      port: 443
      token: abc123
      organization: 1234567891234567
      cluster: 01234-23423-coffeetime
      connect_retries: 5
      connect_timeout: 60
```

**Thrift connection**
```
your_profile_name:
  target: dev
  outputs:
    dev:
      method: thrift
      type: spark
      schema: analytics
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 10001
      user: hadoop
      connect_retries: 5
      connect_timeout: 60
```



### Usage Notes

**Model Configuration**

The following configurations can be supplied to models run with the dbt-spark plugin:


| Option  | Description                                        | Required?               | Example                  |
|---------|----------------------------------------------------|-------------------------|--------------------------|
| file_format  | The file format to use when creating tables | Optional                | `parquet`              |
| location_root  | The created table uses the specified directory to store its data. The table alias is appended to it. | Optional                | `/mnt/root`              |
| partition_by  | Partition the created table by the specified columns. A directory is created for each partition. | Optional                | `partition_1`              |
| clustered_by  | Each partition in the created table will be split into a fixed number of buckets by the specified columns. | Optional               | `cluster_1`              |
| buckets  | The number of buckets to create while clustering | Required if `clustered_by` is specified                | `8`              |


**Incremental Models**

Spark does not natively support `delete`, `update`, or `merge` statements. As such, [incremental models](https://docs.getdbt.com/docs/configuring-incremental-models)
are implemented differently than usual in this plugin. To use incremental models, specify a `partition_by` clause in your model config.
dbt will use an `insert overwrite` query to overwrite the partitions included in your query. Be sure to re-select _all_ of the relevant
data for a partition when using incremental models.

```
{{ config(
    materialized='incremental',
    partition_by=['date_day'],
    file_format='parquet'
) }}

/*
  Every partition returned by this query will be overwritten
  when this model runs
*/

select
    date_day,
    count(*) as users

from {{ ref('events') }}
where date_day::date >= '2019-01-01'
group by 1
```

### Running locally

A `docker-compose` environment starts a Spark Thrift server and a Postgres database as a Hive Metastore backend.

```
docker-compose up
```

Your profile should look like this:

```
your_profile_name:
  target: local
  outputs:
    local:
      method: thrift
      type: spark
      schema: analytics
      host: 127.0.0.1
      port: 10000
      user: dbt
      connect_retries: 5
      connect_timeout: 60
```

Connecting to the local spark instance:

* The Spark UI should be available at [http://localhost:4040/sqlserver/](http://localhost:4040/sqlserver/)
* The endpoint for SQL-based testing is at `http://localhost:10000` and can be referenced with the Hive or Spark JDBC drivers using connection string `jdbc:hive2://localhost:10000` and default credentials `dbt`:`dbt`

Note that the Hive metastore data is persisted under `./.hive-metastore/`, and the Spark-produced data under `./.spark-warehouse/`. To completely reset you environment run the following:

```
docker-compose down
rm -rf ./.hive-metastore/
rm -rf ./.spark-warehouse/
```
