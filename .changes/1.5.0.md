## dbt-spark 1.5.0 - April 27, 2023

### Features

- Support for data types constraints in Spark following the dbt Core feature #6271 ([#558](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/558))
- Enforce contracts on models materialized as tables and views ([#639](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/639), [#654](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/654))
- Modify adapter to support unified constraint fields ([#655](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/655))
- Modify order of columns in create_table_as to match contract ([#671](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/671))

### Fixes

- Support for iceberg v2 tables.  Added ability to use multiple join conditions to allow for multiple columns to make a row distinct. ([#294](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/294))
- Use take() instead of collect on dataframe to improve the performance ([#526](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/526))
- add merge_exclude_columns tests ([#00](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/00))
- Fix pyodbc type_code -> data_type conversion  ([#665](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/665))
- Fixed issue where table materialization was not always properly refreshing for non-admin users on Databricks ([#725](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/725))

### Under the Hood

- remove tox call to integration tests ([#584](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/584))
- Treat contract config as a python object ([#645](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/645), [#693](https://github.com/dbt-labs/dbt-spark/issues/693))
